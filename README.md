# Small Projects

Welcome to the **Small Projects** repository! This collection contains various small projects developed in Java and Python. Each project is designed to demonstrate specific programming concepts and algorithms.


### Java Projects

1. **2D Game in Terminal**
   - A terminal-based game that mimics the dinosaur game that appears in web browsers when there's no internet connection. The player controls a character that must jump over obstacles to avoid losing the game.

2. **Digital Marketplace**
   - A simple simulation of a digital marketplace where users can browse, add items to a cart, and simulate a purchase transaction. This project is designed to demonstrate basic object-oriented programming concepts.

3. **Encrypt and Decrypt Messages**
   - A program that allows users to input messages and either encrypt or decrypt them using a simple encryption algorithm . This project shows how to handle string manipulation and basic cryptography in Java.

4. **HalfAdder in Java**
   - This project implements a Half Adder, a basic building block of digital circuits, using Java. It demonstrates how to handle binary operations and the concept of logic gates in programming.

5. **Pirates Game**
   - A text-based adventure game where the player controls a pirate ship, navigating through various challenges and obstacles. The game involves choices and logic-based gameplay elements.


6. **Banking System and Accounts**
   - A simple banking system simulation that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account balance.
  
7. **BinaryTree Operations**
   - A project that demonstrates binary tree operations, including sorting, adding elements, and displaying elements in various orders (inorder, postorder, preorder).

8. **Home Control System**
   - A Java application to control home appliances with a simulated interface.

9. **Matrix Program**
   - A program to perform various matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, and transposition.

10. **Selling Automat**
   - A vending machine simulation where users can select items and make payments.

11. **Sorting Array**
   - Demonstrates different sorting algorithms implemented in Java.

12. **Temperature Operations**
   - A simple program to convert temperatures between Kelvin and Celsius.

14. **Testing Strings using Assertion**
   - A project demonstrating string manipulations and assertions to validate string operations.

### Python Projects

1. **Sorting and Searching in Arrays**
   - A collection of sorting and searching algorithms implemented in Python.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** - Most projects are developed using the Java programming language.
- **Python** - A few projects are developed using the Python programming language.
